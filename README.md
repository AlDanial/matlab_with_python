# MATLAB with Python

A collection of MATLAB programs that call Python functions to gain
capability, features, or performance that can't be obtained by 
MATLAB alone.  Some of the examples are based on code from my
book, 
[Python for MATLAB Development](https://www.apress.com/gp/book/9781484272220)
(Apress, 2022, ISBN 978-1-4842-7222-0).

[Python is the Ultimate MATLAB Toolbox](https://al.danial.org/posts/python_is_the_ultimate_matlab_toolbox/)
